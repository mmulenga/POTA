I used a GSuite user on my personal GSuite account (google apps for business) for the management of our documentation in this class, with the user acting as the root user for a Google Drive and all of us having priviliges to create, edit, organize, view files in a CMPT-371 folder.

I am removing the GSuite user as it costs $5/month to maintain, so I have zipped the entire contents of the Google Drive folder we had for this class and uploaded them here, where they'll be safe.
